** SOLID Principle **

S -> Single responsibility Principle : A class should have only one reason to change.

O -> Open Close Principle : Software entity should be open for extension but closed for modification

L -> LisKov Substitution Principle : Subclass must be substitutable for their base type

I -> Interface Segregation Principle : The dependency of one class to another once should depend on the smallest possible interface 
									   Client should not forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

D -> Dependency Inversion Principle : Depend upon abstractions (interfaces) not upon concrete classes.
